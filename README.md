# Basic-Image-Processing
Some basic image processing topics which I learnt during the Image Processing and Digital video Processing courses at Indian Institute of Technology Madras.  These covers my course materials and assignments. Details of theory on each topic will be available in corresponding folders. I will try to stick on to python coding for each of these wiorks here. 

## Topics covered
  ### Image Warping : 
Write a program from scratch for image warping (translation, rotation and scaling). We use the target to source mapping concept and bilinear interpolation.
   
  ##  (coming soon) 
  ### Change Detection using Image Warping  :
 Provided two images of a same scene at different view points, find the transd=formation between them using SIFT features and Homography.  Rewarp the images to detect changes between the images.
 
 ### Image stitching:
 
 ### Histogram modifications
 
 ### Space variant and invariant blurring
 
 ### K means clustering for segmentation
 
 ### Background modeling and change detection
