# Change Detection by Image Warping:

Given two images with the second image being a warped version of first with change. This programme helps to align the two images to get the changed regions.

For image alignment we need to know the warps undergone by the second image w.r.t the first image. There are different ways for image alignment and one such method is using features. SIFT is one way to extract features from two images and find the warps undergone. We will study about it in the next work. Here we are given the correspondance (extracted by SIFT or other feature descriptor).
